# 🦊✨ One-Tailed Kitsune & Archmage Warlock

> *"Sometimes I break things just to see if I can bind the chaos to my will."*

Welcome to my eldritch laboratory where **magic and technology** intertwine in ways that defy mortal comprehension. This is not a neat portfolio—this is a **living grimoire** of experiments, rituals, and arcane configurations bound by ancient pacts of security and sealed with microsegmentation.

---

## 🏰 The Sanctum

My home-grown IT sorcery operates on a principle as old as magic itself: **contain the chaos, enforce boundaries, anticipate disturbance**. Every node is a servant bound to purpose. Every packet is divined before it manifests.

### 🛡️ The Binding Rituals

**Network Divination & Enforcement**
- **OPNsense Firewall** stands vigilant at the perimeter, wielding DPI to divine packet intentions before they pass through
- **Unifi Zone-Based Firewalling** carves the realm into isolated microcosms, each segregated by strict VLAN enforcement and default-deny incantations
- **Calico Network Policies** within the K8s cluster enforce microsegmentation between pods and services through routing sorcery
- **BGP Routing Rituals** channel unseen currents through the network topology via eBPF magic, announcing presence and discovering new pathways

**Container & Orchestration Sorcery**
- **Talos Linux** conjures ephemeral, immutable Kubernetes nodes—each a secure stone in the foundation
- **Calico CNI** binds with eBPF magic to provide network policies so strict, even light fears to cross them
- **Proxmox & vSphere** summon virtual sanctuaries where experiments flourish without touching the material plane
- **TrueNAS** guards the vaults—data at rest, encrypted and replicated

**Infrastructure Prophecy** *(Planned Rituals)*
- **Ansible Automation** shall orchestrate configurations across the realm—declarative incantations to bind servants to purpose
- **ArgoCD** will manifest gitops declarations into reality—code becomes being

## 🧪 The Experiments

This lab is **alive and evolving**. Experiments happen in isolation. Failures are contained. Successes are replicated. Everything is bound by these principles:

- **Sandboxed Rituals** 🧪 — Test forbidden arts in Docker containers and ephemeral environments
- **Microsegmented Coven** 🔮 — Each service knows only its purpose; traffic routed through eBPF, isolation enforced via Calico and Unifi VLANs
- **Network Divination** 🔍 — OPNsense DPI observes, logs, alerts before chaos spreads
- **Gitops Configuration** ✨ — YAML declared, versioned, awaiting ArgoCD manifestation

---

## 📜 The Pacts Binding This Realm

- **Zero Trust by Design** — No entity is inherently trusted; all traffic is inspected, all access is earned
- **Immutability Where Possible** — Talos nodes cannot be corrupted; they are discarded and summoned anew
- **Observability is Prerequisite** — What cannot be measured cannot be controlled
- **Chaos is a Teacher** — Break things, learn, rebuild stronger

## 🌙 A Word from the Warlock

This is my playground. My laboratory. My grimoire made manifest. Here, infrastructure becomes art. Security becomes obsession. And the boundary between "why would you do that?" and "absolutely genius" blurs like smoke.

If you wander these halls, tread carefully. Touch nothing without understanding. And if you find something broken, well... consider it an invitation to fix it. 🦊✨
