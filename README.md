One-Tailed Kitsune Archmage Warlock | Keeper of Homelab Pacts

## About me
I am a one-tailed Kitsune, weaving spells of code and conjuring infrastructure in my private IT sorcery lab.  
Every experiment, every ritual, every network configuration is bound by ancient pacts — sandboxed rituals to contain chaos, and microsegmented wards to enforce order.  

Containers and virtual machines are my familiars, obeying my commands… mostly. Magic and technology intertwine here, revealing secrets only the daring dare explore.

## Arcane Pacts
- **Sandboxed Rituals:** Safely test forbidden arts in isolated containers or virtual sanctuaries.  
- **Microsegmented Coven:** Enforce strict boundaries between spells and servants, maintaining harmony across the network.  
- **Talos Conjurations:** Summon multi-node clusters with Calico enchantments, guarding the sanctum.  
- **Network Divination:** Observe the unseen currents of packets and protocols, anticipating disturbances before they manifest.
